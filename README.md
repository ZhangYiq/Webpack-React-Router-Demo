# Webpack-React-Router-Demo
this is a demo for me to learn how to create react project with webpack and react-router.And how to decrease the bundle's size
it includes bundle.js && vendor.js,you can open index.html directly.
if you want to make some changes;you need to install node.js and install the webpack and webpack-dev-server.and cd the root folder and run 'npm install'(dependencies in package.json).then run'ipm start'.
